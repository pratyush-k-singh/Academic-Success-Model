# Kaggle Competition Solution: Predicting Academic Success

This repository contains a solution for a Kaggle competition focused on predicting academic success. The project includes three main scripts for data analysis, model training, and generating predictions. The analysis results, including plots and tables, are saved in a separate directory.

## Project Structure

- `data_analysis.py`: Script to analyze the data, generate tables and plots, and save the results.
- `train_model.py`: Script to train the machine learning model using the provided dataset.
- `make_predictions.py`: Script to generate predictions using the trained model and output the results numerically and visually.
- `requirements.txt`: File containing the required Python packages for this project.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is assumed to be split into training and testing data. The scripts handle the data loading, preprocessing, and splitting internally.

- Training data: `train.csv`
- Testing data: `test.csv`

These files should be placed in the same directory as the Python scripts.

## Acknowledgments

This project is a submission for a Kaggle competition. Special thanks to the Kaggle community for their support and resources.
